export const logicalFallacies: LogicalFallacy[] = [
  { id: 1, name: "Ad Hominem", definition: "This fallacy occurs when someone rejects or criticizes another person's view on the basis of personal characteristics, background, physical appearance, or other features irrelevant to the argument at hand.", example: "You can't trust Dr. Smith's medical advice on dieting because she is overweight. This attacks Dr. Smith's personal appearance, which is irrelevant to the scientific validity of her medical recommendations.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 2, name: "Tu Quoque (Appeal to Hypocrisy)", definition: "A specific type of ad hominem fallacy that dismisses an argument by pointing out hypocrisy in the arguer. It deflects criticism by turning it back on the accuser, but the arguer's hypocrisy doesn't invalidate their argument.", example: "My father told me not to speed because it's dangerous, but I don't have to listen to him because he got a speeding ticket last year. The father's past actions don't change the fact that speeding is objectively dangerous.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 3, name: "Genetic Fallacy", definition: "This fallacy involves accepting or rejecting a claim based on its origin, source, or history, rather than evaluating its current merit or evidence. The source of an idea is independent of its truth or falsehood.", example: "That car can't possibly be any good; it was made in a country known for cheap products. This judges the car based on its place of manufacture, not on its actual performance, safety ratings, or build quality.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 4, name: "Ad Populum (Bandwagon)", definition: "This fallacy asserts that a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it. It appeals to the desire to fit in and be on the winning side, but the popularity of an idea has no bearing on its validity.", example: "Millions of people have switched to this new smartphone, so it must be the best one on the market. The phone's popularity could be due to successful marketing rather than superior features or quality.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 5, name: "Appeal to Authority (Ad Verecundiam)", definition: "This occurs when an argument relies on the testimony of an authority figure who is not an expert in the relevant field. While citing relevant experts is a valid part of an argument, citing an irrelevant authority is fallacious.", example: "A famous actor said in an interview that this specific brand of vitamin C will prevent colds, so I'm stocking up. The actor is an authority on acting, not on immunology or nutrition.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 6, name: "Appeal to Nature", definition: "This is the argument that something is good because it is 'natural,' or bad because it is 'unnatural.' This is a fallacy because the naturalness of something is not inherently linked to its positive or negative qualities.", example: "You shouldn't get vaccinated; it's unnatural. It's better to build immunity through natural infection. This ignores the fact that many natural things, like cyanide, arsenic, and deadly viruses, are extremely harmful.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 7, name: "Appeal to Tradition (Ad Antiquitatem)", definition: "This fallacy argues that a thesis must be correct because it has a long-standing tradition behind it. The fact that an idea has been around for a long time does not automatically make it true or better than newer ideas.", example: "Our company has used this management structure for fifty years and has been successful, so there is no need to change it. This ignores the possibility that market conditions have changed and a new structure might be even more effective.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 8, name: "Appeal to Poverty (Argumentum ad Lazarum)", definition: "This fallacy is the formal fallacy of thinking a conclusion is correct because the speaker is poor, or it is incorrect because the speaker is rich.", example: "The monks have forsworn all material possessions. They must have achieved enlightenment.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 9, name: "Appeal to Wealth (Argumentum ad Crumenam)", definition: "This fallacy, also known as Argumentum ad Crumenam, assumes that an argument is correct because the speaker is wealthy or, conversely, that an argument is incorrect because the speaker is poor. Financial success is not a measure of an argument's truthfulness.", example: "If you're so smart, why aren't you rich? That billionaire says this investment is a sure thing, and he should know. This equates financial success with expertise in all areas.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 10, name: "Moralistic Fallacy", definition: "This fallacy moves from a statement about how things *ought* to be to a factual claim about how things *are*. It assumes the world will adapt to our moral beliefs, which is a form of wishful thinking.", example: "Everyone should be treated equally, therefore there are no innate genetic differences in abilities between people. The moral imperative for equal treatment does not logically entail a factual conclusion about biological uniformity.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 11, name: "Naturalistic Fallacy (Is-Ought Fallacy)", definition: "The inverse of the moralistic fallacy, this occurs when someone argues from a statement of fact (what 'is') to a statement of value (what 'ought' to be). It assumes that the way things are is the way they should be.", example: "Because animals in nature eat meat, it is morally acceptable for humans to eat meat. This argument takes a descriptive fact about the natural world and tries to derive a moral prescription from it.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 12, name: "Red Herring", definition: "This is a tactic of distraction. An arguer commits a red herring fallacy by introducing an irrelevant topic into a discussion to divert attention from the original issue. The goal is to shift the debate to a new topic.", example: "When asked about his voting record on environmental protection, a senator responds, 'I'm much more concerned about the threat of terrorism. We must keep our country safe.' This avoids the environmental question.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 13, name: "Straw Man", definition: "This fallacy occurs when someone distorts, misrepresents, or exaggerates an opponent's position to make it easier to attack. Instead of refuting the actual argument, they knock down a weaker, manufactured version.", example: "Person A: 'I think we should increase funding for public schools.' Person B: 'So you're saying we should just throw unlimited money at a broken system and ignore our national debt? That's fiscally irresponsible!'", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 14, name: "Appeal to Emotion", definition: "This is a broad category of fallacies that involves manipulating an audience's emotions—such as fear, pity, or joy—in order to win an argument, especially in the absence of factual evidence.", example: "A commercial for a charity shows sad pictures of starving children with moving music, urging viewers to donate. While the cause may be worthy, the ad primarily appeals to pity rather than presenting a logical case.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 15, name: "Appeal to Fear (Argumentum ad Metum)", definition: "A specific type of appeal to emotion where an arguer attempts to create support for an idea by instilling fear of an alternative. Instead of providing evidence, it relies on scare tactics.", example: "If we don't pass this surveillance bill, a major terrorist attack on our soil is inevitable. This argument doesn't provide evidence for the bill's effectiveness but uses fear to push for its passage.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 16, name: "Appeal to Flattery", definition: "This fallacy involves using flattery and compliments to persuade an audience to accept a conclusion, rather than providing evidence. The appeal is to the listener's vanity, not their intellect.", example: "A person of your refined taste can surely see the superior quality of this expensive artwork. The compliment is intended to make the potential buyer more agreeable.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 17, name: "Appeal to Pity (Argumentum ad Misericordiam)", definition: "This fallacy attempts to win support for an argument or idea by exploiting the opponent's feelings of pity or guilt. The emotional appeal is used as a substitute for a reasoned argument.", example: "Professor, I know I failed the exam, but I've had a really tough semester. If I don't pass this class, I'll lose my scholarship. You have to give me a passing grade.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 18, name: "Appeal to Ridicule", definition: "This fallacy involves presenting an opponent's argument as absurd, ridiculous, or humorous, and therefore not worthy of serious consideration. Mockery is used in place of actual counter-argumentation.", example: "You actually believe in the theory of evolution? So you think your grandfather was a monkey? That's hilarious! This caricature is meant to mock the position rather than engage with the evidence.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 19, name: "Appeal to Spite", definition: "This fallacy attempts to sway an audience by exploiting their existing feelings of bitterness, spite, or resentment towards the opposing side. The argument is based on animosity rather than logic.", example: "Why would you support a policy proposed by that party? Remember how they blocked the bill we all wanted last year? Let's vote against this just to pay them back.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 20, name: "Wishful Thinking", definition: "This fallacy occurs when a person concludes that a proposition must be true because they want it to be true. The desire for something to be true is used as evidence for its truthfulness.", example: "I'm sure I'll get the job because it would be perfect for me and I really need it. The speaker's desire for the job has no bearing on the objective factors the employer will use.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 21, name: "Appeal to Novelty (Argumentum ad Novitatem)", definition: "This fallacy claims that an idea or proposal is correct or superior solely because it is new and modern. Novelty is not evidence of quality or truth.", example: "Our company needs to switch to this new management software. It's the latest version, so it must be much more efficient than our old system.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 22, name: "Argument from Incredulity", definition: "This fallacy asserts that a proposition must be false because it contradicts one's personal expectations or beliefs, or because it is difficult to imagine. A person's inability to comprehend something does not make it untrue.", example: "I find it impossible to believe that the vastness of the universe could have emerged from a single point in the Big Bang. Therefore, the theory must be wrong.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 23, name: "Appeal to Ignorance (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam)", definition: "This fallacy asserts that a proposition is true because there is no evidence to prove it false, or that it is false because there is no evidence to prove it true. A lack of evidence is not evidence of absence.", example: "No one has ever been able to prove that ghosts don't exist, so it is reasonable to believe that they do. The burden of proof lies with the person making the claim.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 24, name: "Appeal to Self-Evident Truth", definition: "This fallacy involves presenting a claim as 'self-evident' or 'obvious' and therefore needing no supporting evidence. This tactic attempts to shut down debate by asserting that anyone who disagrees is foolish.", example: "It's self-evident that raising taxes on corporations hurts the economy. This is presented as an undeniable fact, but it is a complex economic claim that requires evidence.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 25, name: "Appeal to Stone (Argumentum ad Lapidem)", definition: "This fallacy consists of dismissing a statement as absurd without giving any proof of its absurdity. It is a refusal to engage with the argument itself.", example: "Person A lays out a detailed argument for a policy change. Person B responds by simply saying, 'That is the most absurd proposition I have ever heard,' and offers no counter-argument.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 26, name: "Burden of Proof Fallacy", definition: "This fallacy occurs when someone makes a claim but puts the burden of proof on the other party to disprove it, rather than providing evidence for their own claim. The rule of thumb is that he who asserts must prove.", example: "I claim that a teapot is orbiting the sun between Earth and Mars. Since you cannot prove that it isn't there, you must accept my claim as true.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 27, name: "Fallacy of Composition", definition: "This is the error of assuming that what is true of a part is also true of the whole. The properties of the parts do not necessarily transfer to the properties of the complete entity.", example: "Every player on this basketball team is a superstar. Therefore, the team itself must be the best in the league. This ignores that a team of superstars may not have good chemistry.", category: "ambiguity" },
  { id: 28, name: "Fallacy of Division", definition: "The inverse of the fallacy of composition, this is the error of assuming that what is true of the whole is also true of its parts. The properties of the whole do not necessarily apply to each individual component.", example: "Our company is very profitable and innovative. Therefore, every single employee in our company must be profitable and innovative.", category: "ambiguity" },
  { id: 29, name: "Fallacy of the Single Cause (Causal Oversimplification)", definition: "This fallacy occurs when it is assumed that there is a single, simple cause for an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of only jointly sufficient causes.", example: "The school shooting happened because of violent video games. This explanation oversimplifies a complex event, ignoring other potential contributing factors.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 30, name: "Inflation of Conflict", definition: "This fallacy occurs when someone exaggerates a minor or internal disagreement among experts in a field to dismiss the field's consensus entirely. It creates the false impression that there is no agreement.", example: "Scientists disagree about the exact rate of climate change, so the whole concept of global warming is probably not true. This ignores the overwhelming consensus among scientists.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 31, name: "Ludic Fallacy", definition: "This is the misuse of games and statistical models of chance to represent complex, real-world situations. It involves assuming that the neat, predictable probabilities of a game apply to the messy, unpredictable nature of reality.", example: "Based on my financial models, the market has a 0.1% chance of crashing this year, so my investments are perfectly safe. This treats the economy like a casino game with known odds.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 32, name: "Moving the Goalposts", definition: "This fallacy occurs when the criteria for proof or acceptance of an argument are changed after the initial criteria have been met. It is an unfair tactic used to avoid conceding a point.", example: "Person A: 'Prove to me that your new policy will reduce costs.' Person B provides a detailed report. Person A replies, 'Okay, but now you have to prove it won't negatively impact employee morale.'", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 33, name: "Slippery Slope", definition: "This fallacy asserts that a relatively small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect, without sufficient evidence for the inevitability of the chain.", example: "If we allow the city to ban plastic straws, the next thing you know, they'll be banning all plastic bags, then plastic containers, and eventually we won't be able to buy anything in plastic!", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 34, name: "Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy", definition: "This fallacy is committed when differences in data are ignored, but similarities are stressed. It involves cherry-picking data clusters to suit an argument, or finding a pattern to fit a presumption.", example: "A soda company points out that in the five states where their sales are highest, three of them are also in the top ten healthiest states. They conclude their soda is part of a healthy lifestyle.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 35, name: "Appeal to Probability", definition: "This is a fallacy of assuming that because something could happen, it will inevitably happen. This confuses possibility with certainty or high probability.", example: "There are so many cars on the road, it's inevitable that I will get into a major accident someday, so I might as well drive recklessly.", category: "relevance" },
  { id: 36, name: "Wrong Direction (Causal Reversal)", definition: "This fallacy occurs when cause and effect are reversed. The arguer claims that X causes Y, when in fact it is Y that causes X.", example: "Observing that people who are very ill are often in hospitals, someone concludes that hospitals make people ill. In reality, people go to hospitals because they are already ill.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 37, name: "Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle", definition: "This is a formal fallacy in a categorical syllogism where the middle term (the one that connects the two premises) is not distributed, meaning it doesn't refer to all members of its category.", example: "All dogs are mammals. All cats are mammals. Therefore, all dogs are cats. Here, 'mammals' is the undistributed middle term.", category: "formal" },
  { id: 38, name: "Affirming the Consequent", definition: "A formal fallacy of inferring the converse from the original statement. The argument has the invalid form: If P, then Q. Q is true. Therefore, P is true.", example: "If it is raining, then the street is wet. The street is wet. Therefore, it must be raining. This is fallacious because the street could be wet from a street cleaner.", category: "formal" },
  { id: 39, name: "Denying the Antecedent", definition: "A formal fallacy of inferring the inverse from the original statement. The argument has the invalid form: If P, then Q. P is not true. Therefore, Q is not true.", example: "If you have a driver's license, you are over 16 years old. You do not have a driver's license. Therefore, you are not over 16 years old. This is false; a 25-year-old could simply choose not to have a license.", category: "formal" },
  { id: 40, name: "Correlation Implies Causation (Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc)", definition: "This fallacy is the error of concluding that because two events occur together, one must be the cause of the other. It overlooks the possibility of a third factor causing both, or that the correlation is purely coincidental.", example: "As ice cream sales increase, so do the number of shark attacks. Therefore, buying ice cream causes shark attacks. In reality, hot weather is the cause of both.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 41, name: "Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc", definition: "Literally 'after this, therefore because of this,' this fallacy occurs when it is assumed that because one event followed another, the first event must have caused the second.", example: "I wore my lucky jersey and my team won the game. Therefore, my jersey caused the team to win. The temporal succession of events is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 42, name: "Regression Fallacy", definition: "This fallacy fails to account for natural fluctuations and regression to the mean. It occurs when an exceptional outcome is observed, an action is taken, and then the outcome regresses to a more normal level.", example: "A patient with back pain tries a new herbal remedy and feels much better a week later. They attribute their recovery to the remedy, but it's more likely that their extreme pain was an outlier that naturally regressed to a less painful average state.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 43, name: "Third-Cause Fallacy", definition: "A variation of the 'correlation implies causation' fallacy, this error occurs when two correlated events are assumed to have a causal relationship, while in reality, a third, unacknowledged factor is the cause of both.", example: "The number of storks in a region correlates with the human birth rate. Therefore, storks deliver babies. The third cause is the size of the region; larger regions have more storks and more people.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 44, name: "Gambler's Fallacy", definition: "This is the mistaken belief that if a particular event occurs more frequently than normal during the past, it is less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa), when the probability is independent.", example: "At a roulette wheel, after a series of ten red numbers, a gambler believes that a black number is 'due' to come up. In reality, the probability is the same on every spin.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 45, name: "Hot Hand Fallacy", definition: "The inverse of the Gambler's Fallacy, this is the fallacious belief that a person who has experienced success with a random event has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts.", example: "A basketball player makes several shots in a row, and fans believe they have a 'hot hand' and are more likely to make their next shot. Statistically, each shot is an independent event.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 46, name: "Subjunctive Fallacy (Counterfactual Fallacy)", definition: "This fallacy involves making claims about what *would have* happened if a different course of action had been taken. Such claims are speculative and cannot be proven.", example: "If only I had studied for one more hour, I would have passed the exam. While plausible, it's impossible to prove; perhaps the exam was simply too difficult.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 47, name: "Survivorship Bias", definition: "A logical error of concentrating on the people or things that 'survived' some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions.", example: "During WWII, researchers analyzed returning bombers to see where they were hit by flak, suggesting armor be added to those areas. A statistician pointed out they should armor the areas that were *not* hit, as planes hit in those spots likely didn't survive.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 48, name: "Sunk Cost Fallacy (Concorde Fallacy)", definition: "This is the fallacy of continuing a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money, or effort), whether or not the current costs outweigh the expected benefits.", example: "We've already spent millions developing this new product. It's not selling well, but we can't just stop now; we have to keep funding it to justify the initial investment.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 49, name: "Teleological Fallacy (Fallacy of Final Cause)", definition: "This is the assumption that natural phenomena have a purpose, goal, or design, and that they act in order to achieve that purpose. It attributes intention to mindless, mechanistic processes.", example: "The purpose of rain is to water the plants and fill the rivers. This assigns a goal to a meteorological process that is actually driven by physics, not by a need to help plants.", category: "causal" },
  { id: 50, name: "Association Fallacy", definition: "This fallacy asserts that qualities of one thing are inherently qualities of another, merely by an irrelevant association. This is often used to link a person or idea to something negative.", example: "My political opponent once accepted a campaign donation from a controversial corporation. Therefore, my opponent must endorse that corporation's unethical practices.", category: "relevance" }
