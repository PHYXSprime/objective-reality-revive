1,"Ad Hominem","This fallacy occurs when someone rejects or criticizes another person's view on the basis of personal characteristics, background, physical appearance, or other features irrelevant to the argument at hand.","You can't trust Dr. Smith's medical advice on dieting because she is overweight. This attacks Dr. Smith's personal appearance, which is irrelevant to the scientific validity of her medical recommendations.","relevance"
2,"Tu Quoque (Appeal to Hypocrisy)","A specific type of ad hominem fallacy that dismisses an argument by pointing out hypocrisy in the arguer. It deflects criticism by turning it back on the accuser, but the arguer's hypocrisy doesn't invalidate their argument.","My father told me not to speed because it's dangerous, but I don't have to listen to him because he got a speeding ticket last year. The father's past actions don't change the fact that speeding is objectively dangerous.","relevance"
3,"Genetic Fallacy","This fallacy involves accepting or rejecting a claim based on its origin, source, or history, rather than evaluating its current merit or evidence. The source of an idea is independent of its truth or falsehood.","That car can't possibly be any good; it was made in a country known for cheap products. This judges the car based on its place of manufacture, not on its actual performance, safety ratings, or build quality.","relevance"
4,"Ad Populum (Bandwagon)","This fallacy asserts that a proposition must be true because many or most people believe it. It appeals to the desire to fit in and be on the winning side, but the popularity of an idea has no bearing on its validity.","Millions of people have switched to this new smartphone, so it must be the best one on the market. The phone's popularity could be due to successful marketing rather than superior features or quality.","relevance"
5,"Appeal to Authority (Ad Verecundiam)","This occurs when an argument relies on the testimony of an authority figure who is not an expert in the relevant field. While citing relevant experts is a valid part of an argument, citing an irrelevant authority is fallacious.","A famous actor said in an interview that this specific brand of vitamin C will prevent colds, so I'm stocking up. The actor is an authority on acting, not on immunology or nutrition.","relevance"
6,"Appeal to Nature","This is the argument that something is good because it is 'natural,' or bad because it is 'unnatural.' This is a fallacy because the naturalness of something is not inherently linked to its positive or negative qualities.","You shouldn't get vaccinated; it's unnatural. It's better to build immunity through natural infection. This ignores the fact that many natural things, like cyanide, arsenic, and deadly viruses, are extremely harmful.","relevance"
7,"Appeal to Tradition (Ad Antiquitatem)","This fallacy argues that a thesis must be correct because it has a long-standing tradition behind it. The fact that an idea has been around for a long time does not automatically make it true or better than newer ideas.","Our company has used this management structure for fifty years and has been successful, so there is no need to change it. This ignores the possibility that market conditions have changed and a new structure might be even more effective.","relevance"
8,"Appeal to Poverty (Argumentum ad Lazarum)","This fallacy is the formal fallacy of thinking a conclusion is correct because the speaker is poor, or it is incorrect because the speaker is rich.","The monks have forsworn all material possessions. They must have achieved enlightenment.","relevance"
9,"Appeal to Wealth (Argumentum ad Crumenam)","This fallacy, also known as Argumentum ad Crumenam, assumes that an argument is correct because the speaker is wealthy or, conversely, that an argument is incorrect because the speaker is poor. Financial success is not a measure of an argument's truthfulness.","If you're so smart, why aren't you rich? That billionaire says this investment is a sure thing, and he should know. This equates financial success with expertise in all areas.","relevance"
10,"Moralistic Fallacy","This fallacy moves from a statement about how things *ought* to be to a factual claim about how things *are*. It assumes the world will adapt to our moral beliefs, which is a form of wishful thinking.","Everyone should be treated equally, therefore there are no innate genetic differences in abilities between people. The moral imperative for equal treatment does not logically entail a factual conclusion about biological uniformity.","relevance"
11,"Naturalistic Fallacy (Is-Ought Fallacy)","The inverse of the moralistic fallacy, this occurs when someone argues from a statement of fact (what 'is') to a statement of value (what 'ought' to be). It assumes that the way things are is the way they should be.","Because animals in nature eat meat, it is morally acceptable for humans to eat meat. This argument takes a descriptive fact about the natural world and tries to derive a moral prescription from it.","relevance"
12,"Red Herring","This is a tactic of distraction. An arguer commits a red herring fallacy by introducing an irrelevant topic into a discussion to divert attention from the original issue. The goal is to shift the debate to a new topic.","When asked about his voting record on environmental protection, a senator responds, 'I'm much more concerned about the threat of terrorism. We must keep our country safe.' This avoids the environmental question.","relevance"
13,"Straw Man","This fallacy occurs when someone distorts, misrepresents, or exaggerates an opponent's position to make it easier to attack. Instead of refuting the actual argument, they knock down a weaker, manufactured version.","Person A: 'I think we should increase funding for public schools.' Person B: 'So you're saying we should just throw unlimited money at a broken system and ignore our national debt? That's fiscally irresponsible!'","relevance"
14,"Appeal to Emotion","This is a broad category of fallacies that involves manipulating an audience's emotions—such as fear, pity, or joy—in order to win an argument, especially in the absence of factual evidence.","A commercial for a charity shows sad pictures of starving children with moving music, urging viewers to donate. While the cause may be worthy, the ad primarily appeals to pity rather than presenting a logical case.","relevance"
15,"Appeal to Fear (Argumentum ad Metum)","A specific type of appeal to emotion where an arguer attempts to create support for an idea by instilling fear of an alternative. Instead of providing evidence, it relies on scare tactics.","If we don't pass this surveillance bill, a major terrorist attack on our soil is inevitable. This argument doesn't provide evidence for the bill's effectiveness but uses fear to push for its passage.","relevance"
16,"Appeal to Flattery","This fallacy involves using flattery and compliments to persuade an audience to accept a conclusion, rather than providing evidence. The appeal is to the listener's vanity, not their intellect.","A person of your refined taste can surely see the superior quality of this expensive artwork. The compliment is intended to make the potential buyer more agreeable.","relevance"
17,"Appeal to Pity (Argumentum ad Misericordiam)","This fallacy attempts to win support for an argument or idea by exploiting the opponent's feelings of pity or guilt. The emotional appeal is used as a substitute for a reasoned argument.","Professor, I know I failed the exam, but I've had a really tough semester. If I don't pass this class, I'll lose my scholarship. You have to give me a passing grade.","relevance"
18,"Appeal to Ridicule","This fallacy involves presenting an opponent's argument as absurd, ridiculous, or humorous, and therefore not worthy of serious consideration. Mockery is used in place of actual counter-argumentation.","You actually believe in the theory of evolution? So you think your grandfather was a monkey? That's hilarious! This caricature is meant to mock the position rather than engage with the evidence.","relevance"
19,"Appeal to Spite","This fallacy attempts to sway an audience by exploiting their existing feelings of bitterness, spite, or resentment towards the opposing side. The argument is based on animosity rather than logic.","Why would you support a policy proposed by that party? Remember how they blocked the bill we all wanted last year? Let's vote against this just to pay them back.","relevance"
20,"Wishful Thinking","This fallacy occurs when a person concludes that a proposition must be true because they want it to be true. The desire for something to be true is used as evidence for its truthfulness.","I'm sure I'll get the job because it would be perfect for me and I really need it. The speaker's desire for the job has no bearing on the objective factors the employer will use.","relevance"
21,"Appeal to Novelty (Argumentum ad Novitatem)","This fallacy claims that an idea or proposal is correct or superior solely because it is new and modern. Novelty is not evidence of quality or truth.","Our company needs to switch to this new management software. It's the latest version, so it must be much more efficient than our old system.","relevance"
22,"Argument from Incredulity","This fallacy asserts that a proposition must be false because it contradicts one's personal expectations or beliefs, or because it is difficult to imagine. A person's inability to comprehend something does not make it untrue.","I find it impossible to believe that the vastness of the universe could have emerged from a single point in the Big Bang. Therefore, the theory must be wrong.","relevance"
23,"Appeal to Ignorance (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam)","This fallacy asserts that a proposition is true because there is no evidence to prove it false, or that it is false because there is no evidence to prove it true. A lack of evidence is not evidence of absence.","No one has ever been able to prove that ghosts don't exist, so it is reasonable to believe that they do. The burden of proof lies with the person making the claim.","relevance"
24,"Appeal to Self-Evident Truth","This fallacy involves presenting a claim as 'self-evident' or 'obvious' and therefore needing no supporting evidence. This tactic attempts to shut down debate by asserting that anyone who disagrees is foolish.","It's self-evident that raising taxes on corporations hurts the economy. This is presented as an undeniable fact, but it is a complex economic claim that requires evidence.","relevance"
25,"Appeal to Stone (Argumentum ad Lapidem)","This fallacy consists of dismissing a statement as absurd without giving any proof of its absurdity. It is a refusal to engage with the argument itself.","Person A lays out a detailed argument for a policy change. Person B responds by simply saying, 'That is the most absurd proposition I have ever heard,' and offers no counter-argument.","relevance"
26,"Burden of Proof Fallacy","This fallacy occurs when someone makes a claim but puts the burden of proof on the other party to disprove it, rather than providing evidence for their own claim. The rule of thumb is that he who asserts must prove.","I claim that a teapot is orbiting the sun between Earth and Mars. Since you cannot prove that it isn't there, you must accept my claim as true.","relevance"
27,"Fallacy of Composition","This is the error of assuming that what is true of a part is also true of the whole. The properties of the parts do not necessarily transfer to the properties of the complete entity.","Every player on this basketball team is a superstar. Therefore, the team itself must be the best in the league. This ignores that a team of superstars may not have good chemistry.","ambiguity"
28,"Fallacy of Division","The inverse of the fallacy of composition, this is the error of assuming that what is true of the whole is also true of its parts. The properties of the whole do not necessarily apply to each individual component.","Our company is very profitable and innovative. Therefore, every single employee in our company must be profitable and innovative.","ambiguity"
29,"Fallacy of the Single Cause (Causal Oversimplification)","This fallacy occurs when it is assumed that there is a single, simple cause for an outcome when in reality it may have been caused by a number of only jointly sufficient causes.","The school shooting happened because of violent video games. This explanation oversimplifies a complex event, ignoring other potential contributing factors.","causal"
30,"Inflation of Conflict","This fallacy occurs when someone exaggerates a minor or internal disagreement among experts in a field to dismiss the field's consensus entirely. It creates the false impression that there is no agreement.","Scientists disagree about the exact rate of climate change, so the whole concept of global warming is probably not true. This ignores the overwhelming consensus among scientists.","relevance"
31,"Ludic Fallacy","This is the misuse of games and statistical models of chance to represent complex, real-world situations. It involves assuming that the neat, predictable probabilities of a game apply to the messy, unpredictable nature of reality.","Based on my financial models, the market has a 0.1% chance of crashing this year, so my investments are perfectly safe. This treats the economy like a casino game with known odds.","relevance"
32,"Moving the Goalposts","This fallacy occurs when the criteria for proof or acceptance of an argument are changed after the initial criteria have been met. It is an unfair tactic used to avoid conceding a point.","Person A: 'Prove to me that your new policy will reduce costs.' Person B provides a detailed report. Person A replies, 'Okay, but now you have to prove it won't negatively impact employee morale.'","relevance"
33,"Slippery Slope","This fallacy asserts that a relatively small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant (usually negative) effect, without sufficient evidence for the inevitability of the chain.","If we allow the city to ban plastic straws, the next thing you know, they'll be banning all plastic bags, then plastic containers, and eventually we won't be able to buy anything in plastic!","relevance"
34,"Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy","This fallacy is committed when differences in data are ignored, but similarities are stressed. It involves cherry-picking data clusters to suit an argument, or finding a pattern to fit a presumption.","A soda company points out that in the five states where their sales are highest, three of them are also in the top ten healthiest states. They conclude their soda is part of a healthy lifestyle.","relevance"
35,"Appeal to Probability","This is a fallacy of assuming that because something could happen, it will inevitably happen. This confuses possibility with certainty or high probability.","There are so many cars on the road, it's inevitable that I will get into a major accident someday, so I might as well drive recklessly.","relevance"
36,"Wrong Direction (Causal Reversal)","This fallacy occurs when cause and effect are reversed. The arguer claims that X causes Y, when in fact it is Y that causes X.","Observing that people who are very ill are often in hospitals, someone concludes that hospitals make people ill. In reality, people go to hospitals because they are already ill.","causal"
37,"Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle","This is a formal fallacy in a categorical syllogism where the middle term (the one that connects the two premises) is not distributed, meaning it doesn't refer to all members of its category.","All dogs are mammals. All cats are mammals. Therefore, all dogs are cats. Here, 'mammals' is the undistributed middle term.","formal"
38,"Affirming the Consequent","A formal fallacy of inferring the converse from the original statement. The argument has the invalid form: If P, then Q. Q is true. Therefore, P is true.","If it is raining, then the street is wet. The street is wet. Therefore, it must be raining. This is fallacious because the street could be wet from a street cleaner.","formal"
39,"Denying the Antecedent","A formal fallacy of inferring the inverse from the original statement. The argument has the invalid form: If P, then Q. P is not true. Therefore, Q is not true.","If you have a driver's license, you are over 16 years old. You do not have a driver's license. Therefore, you are not over 16 years old. This is false; a 25-year-old could simply choose not to have a license.","formal"
40,"Correlation Implies Causation (Cum Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc)","This fallacy is the error of concluding that because two events occur together, one must be the cause of the other. It overlooks the possibility of a third factor causing both, or that the correlation is purely coincidental.","As ice cream sales increase, so do the number of shark attacks. Therefore, buying ice cream causes shark attacks. In reality, hot weather is the cause of both.","causal"
41,"Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc","Literally 'after this, therefore because of this,' this fallacy occurs when it is assumed that because one event followed another, the first event must have caused the second.","I wore my lucky jersey and my team won the game. Therefore, my jersey caused the team to win. The temporal succession of events is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship.","causal"
42,"Regression Fallacy","This fallacy fails to account for natural fluctuations and regression to the mean. It occurs when an exceptional outcome is observed, an action is taken, and then the outcome regresses to a more normal level.","A patient with back pain tries a new herbal remedy and feels much better a week later. They attribute their recovery to the remedy, but it's more likely that their extreme pain was an outlier that naturally regressed to a less painful average state.","causal"
43,"Third-Cause Fallacy","A variation of the 'correlation implies causation' fallacy, this error occurs when two correlated events are assumed to have a causal relationship, while in reality, a third, unacknowledged factor is the cause of both.","The number of storks in a region correlates with the human birth rate. Therefore, storks deliver babies. The third cause is the size of the region; larger regions have more storks and more people.","causal"
44,"Gambler's Fallacy","This is the mistaken belief that if a particular event occurs more frequently than normal during the past, it is less likely to happen in the future (or vice versa), when the probability is independent.","At a roulette wheel, after a series of ten red numbers, a gambler believes that a black number is 'due' to come up. In reality, the probability is the same on every spin.","causal"
45,"Hot Hand Fallacy","The inverse of the Gambler's Fallacy, this is the fallacious belief that a person who has experienced success with a random event has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts.","A basketball player makes several shots in a row, and fans believe they have a 'hot hand' and are more likely to make their next shot. Statistically, each shot is an independent event.","causal"
46,"Subjunctive Fallacy (Counterfactual Fallacy)","This fallacy involves making claims about what *would have* happened if a different course of action had been taken. Such claims are speculative and cannot be proven.","If only I had studied for one more hour, I would have passed the exam. While plausible, it's impossible to prove; perhaps the exam was simply too difficult.","causal"
47,"Survivorship Bias","A logical error of concentrating on the people or things that 'survived' some process and inadvertently overlooking those that did not because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to false conclusions.","During WWII, researchers analyzed returning bombers to see where they were hit by flak, suggesting armor be added to those areas. A statistician pointed out they should armor the areas that were *not* hit, as planes hit in those spots likely didn't survive.","causal"
48,"Sunk Cost Fallacy (Concorde Fallacy)","This is the fallacy of continuing a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources (time, money, or effort), whether or not the current costs outweigh the expected benefits.","We've already spent millions developing this new product. It's not selling well, but we can't just stop now; we have to keep funding it to justify the initial investment.","causal"
49,"Teleological Fallacy (Fallacy of Final Cause)","This is the assumption that natural phenomena have a purpose, goal, or design, and that they act in order to achieve that purpose. It attributes intention to mindless, mechanistic processes.","The purpose of rain is to water the plants and fill the rivers. This assigns a goal to a meteorological process that is actually driven by physics, not by a need to help plants.","causal"
50,"Association Fallacy","This fallacy asserts that qualities of one thing are inherently qualities of another, merely by an irrelevant association. This is often used to link a person or idea to something negative.","My political opponent once accepted a campaign donation from a controversial corporation. Therefore, my opponent must endorse that corporation's unethical practices.","relevance"
51,"Ecological Fallacy","This fallacy involves making inferences about an individual based on aggregate data for the group to which that individual belongs. Group-level statistics do not necessarily apply to individuals.","A study shows that Country X has a very high national happiness score. My friend is from Country X, so she must be a very happy person. This ignores individual variation.","ambiguity"
52,"Etymological Fallacy","This is the error of arguing that the historical or original meaning of a word (its etymology) is its only correct and current meaning, ignoring the evolution of language and contemporary usage.","Someone argues that the word 'awful' should be a positive term because it originally meant 'full of awe.' This ignores that its meaning has shifted over centuries to mean 'very bad.'","ambiguity"
53,"Historian's Fallacy","This occurs when one assumes that decision-makers of the past viewed events from the same perspective and had the same information as those subsequently analyzing the decision. It's a form of hindsight bias.","The generals in World War I should have known that trench warfare would lead to a stalemate; it was obvious. This ignores the contemporary military theories that guided their decisions.","causal"
54,"Homunculus Fallacy","An argument that attempts to explain a phenomenon in terms of the very phenomenon that it is supposed to explain, creating an infinite regress. It often involves positing a 'little man' or internal agent.","To explain how a person can see, one might claim there is a tiny person inside the brain who watches a screen. This doesn't explain vision; it just displaces the problem.","formal"
55,"If-by-Whiskey","A rhetorical tactic where a speaker appears to support both sides of an issue by using emotionally charged language that will appeal to different audiences. The speaker's actual position remains ambiguous.","A politician on a new tax: 'If by 'tax' you mean taking money from families to fund wasteful programs, I'm against it. But if by 'tax' you mean an investment to build better schools, then I'm for it.'","relevance"
56,"McNamara Fallacy","This fallacy involves making a decision based solely on quantitative metrics and data, while ignoring qualitative factors and information that is difficult to measure.","A school district evaluates its teachers based only on student test scores. This ignores other crucial factors like a teacher's ability to inspire creativity and critical thinking.","relevance"
57,"Nirvana Fallacy (Perfect Solution Fallacy)","This is the error of rejecting any realistic solution because it does not solve a problem completely. It compares a practical proposal to an unrealistic, idealized 'perfect' alternative.","Why should we implement this new recycling program? It won't eliminate all waste, so it's not worth doing. This rejects a positive step forward simply because it is not a perfect solution.","relevance"
58,"Affirming a Disjunct","A formal fallacy with the structure: P or Q. P is true. Therefore, Q is not true. This is only a fallacy when the 'or' is inclusive (meaning both P and Q could be true).","The menu says this meal comes with soup or salad. I am having the soup. Therefore, I am not having the salad. (Many restaurants allow you to have both).","formal"
59,"Denying a Conjunct","A formal fallacy with the structure: It is not the case that (P and Q). Not P. Therefore, Q. The error is assuming that one of the conjuncts must be true.","A defendant cannot be guilty of both murder and manslaughter for the same death. The defendant is not guilty of murder. Therefore, the defendant must be guilty of manslaughter. (The defendant could be innocent of both).","formal"
60,"Fallacy of Exclusive Premises","A formal fallacy in a categorical syllogism where both premises are negative (e.g., 'no X are Y' and 'no Z are X'). No valid conclusion can be drawn from two negative premises.","No fish are mammals. Some dogs are not fish. Therefore, some dogs are not mammals. (The conclusion is false, and the argument structure is invalid).","formal"
61,"Fallacy of Four Terms (Quaternio Terminorum)","A formal fallacy that occurs when a syllogism has four or more terms rather than the required three. This often happens through equivocation, where a single word is used with two different meanings.","All rivers have banks. All banks have money. Therefore, all rivers have money. (The word 'bank' is used with two different meanings, creating four distinct terms).","formal"
62,"Illicit Major","A formal fallacy where the major term (the predicate of the conclusion) is distributed in the conclusion but not in the major premise.","All cats are mammals. No dogs are cats. Therefore, no dogs are mammals. (The term 'mammals' is distributed in the conclusion but not the premise).","formal"
63,"Illicit Minor","A formal fallacy where the minor term (the subject of the conclusion) is distributed in the conclusion but not in the minor premise.","All activists are passionate people. All activists are citizens. Therefore, all citizens are passionate people. (The term 'citizens' is distributed in the conclusion but not the premise).","formal"
64,"Masked-Man Fallacy (Intensional Fallacy)","This formal fallacy involves an invalid substitution of identicals in a statement about belief or knowledge. One's knowledge about an object is not a property of the object itself.","Premise 1: I know who Bruce Wayne is. Premise 2: I do not know who Batman is. Conclusion: Therefore, Bruce Wayne is not Batman. (The argument fails because 'knowing' is about my mental state).","formal"
65,"Quantifier Shift Fallacy","A formal fallacy where the quantifiers in an argument (such as 'all,' 'some,' or 'none') are swapped in an invalid way. The order of quantifiers is crucial to the meaning.","For every person, there exists a dream they hold dear. Therefore, there exists a dream that every person holds dear. This incorrectly shifts from each person having their own dream to all people sharing one single dream.","formal"
66,"False Dilemma (False Dichotomy)","This fallacy presents a situation as having only two alternatives, when in fact other alternatives exist or can exist. It artificially limits choices to force a decision for one side.","You are either with us, or you are with the terrorists. This presents only two options, ignoring the possibility of neutrality, opposition to both sides, or conditional support.","ambiguity"
66,"Bare Assertion Fallacy","This fallacy occurs when a conclusion is offered without any supporting evidence or reasoning. The arguer expects the claim to be accepted simply because they have stated it.","During a debate, a participant states, 'That's just how things are,' and provides no further justification for their position, treating it as an unchallengeable fact.","relevance"
67,"Continuum Fallacy (Fallacy of the Heap)","This fallacy rejects a claim because it is not possible to draw a precise line between two states. It exploits the ambiguity of vague terms.","You can't say for certain when a collection of sand becomes a heap. Therefore, heaps do not exist. The inability to define a precise threshold does not negate the existence of the concept.","ambiguity"
68,"Begging the Question (Circular Reasoning)","An argument where the conclusion is assumed in one of the premises. It's a form of circular reasoning that provides no real evidence, as it essentially argues that a statement is true because it is true.","The Bible is the word of God because it says so in the Bible, and God would not lie. The premise (the Bible is true) is also the conclusion, creating a loop with no external support.","relevance"
69,"Hasty Generalization","This fallacy involves drawing a broad conclusion based on a small or unrepresentative sample size. The conclusion is a leap that is not justified by the evidence.","I met two people from New York and they were both rude. Therefore, everyone from New York is rude. This conclusion is based on an anecdotal sample of two.","causal"
70,"Anecdotal Fallacy","Using a personal experience or an isolated example instead of a sound argument or compelling evidence. It's a type of hasty generalization where the sample size is one.","They say smoking causes cancer, but my grandfather smoked a pack a day and lived to be 90. Therefore, smoking is not harmful. A single anecdote does not disprove statistical evidence.","causal"
71,"No True Scotsman","A way of reinterpreting evidence in order to prevent the refutation of one's position. An arguer using this fallacy modifies their claim in response to a counterexample, by excluding the specific case without justification.","Person A: 'No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.' Person B: 'But my uncle Angus is a Scotsman and he puts sugar on his porridge.' Person A: 'Ah, but no *true* Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.'","relevance"
72,"Equivocation","This is the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning or sense. It often occurs in syllogisms.","The sign said 'Fine for parking here', and since it was fine, I parked there. This equivocates on the word 'fine,' which can mean 'acceptable' or 'a monetary penalty.'","ambiguity"
73,"Amphiboly","A fallacy of ambiguity where the ambiguity lies not in a word or phrase but in the grammatical structure of a sentence. The sentence can be interpreted in more than one way.","The oracle told Croesus that if he went to war with Persia, he would destroy a mighty empire. Croesus went to war and was defeated, destroying his own mighty empire.","ambiguity"
74,"Cherry Picking (Suppressed Evidence)","The act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position.","A politician highlights a single city where their new economic policy has been successful, while deliberately not mentioning the ten other cities where the same policy has failed.","relevance"
75,"Special Pleading","This fallacy occurs when someone applies standards, principles, or rules to other people or circumstances, while making oneself or one's own circumstances exempt from the same rules without justification.","Yes, I believe in freedom of speech for everyone, but my opponent's views are so dangerous they should not be allowed on this campus. This creates a special exception for a case one dislikes.","relevance"
76,"False Equivalence","An argument or comparison that describes a situation in which there is a logical and apparent equivalence, when in fact there is none. It often compares a minor misdeed with a major atrocity.","The person who illegally downloaded a movie is just as bad as the CEO who embezzled millions from the company. They are both thieves. This falsely equates two actions of vastly different scales.","relevance"
77,"Argument to Moderation (False Compromise)","The fallacy that the truth is always in the middle of two opposites. While compromise can be a useful tool, it does not guarantee a logically sound conclusion.","One person says the sky is blue, and another says the sky is yellow. Therefore, the truth must be that the sky is green. This is fallacious because one of the initial positions is factually correct.","relevance"
78,"Reification (Hypostatization)","This is a fallacy of ambiguity, where an abstraction (an abstract belief or hypothetical construct) is treated as if it were a concrete, real event or physical entity.","Justice demands that we punish the guilty. Here, 'justice' is spoken of as a concrete agent that can make demands, when it is actually an abstract concept.","ambiguity"
79,"Psychologist's Fallacy","This occurs when an observer assumes that their subjective interpretation of an event is the same as the subjective experience of the person involved in the event. It confuses one's own standpoint with that of the person being observed.","A therapist, after seeing a client smile when discussing a traumatic event, concludes, 'He must be finding some joy in his past suffering.' The therapist is projecting an interpretation of a smile.","relevance"
80,"Argument from Silence (Argumentum ex Silentio)","A fallacy where a conclusion is based on the absence of evidence rather than the presence of it. It assumes that if a source did not mention something, it must not have happened or existed.","Herodotus, the great historian, never mentions the pyramids of Giza in his writings about Egypt. Therefore, they must not have been there when he visited.","relevance"
81,"Argument from Fallacy (Fallacist's Fallacy)","The formal fallacy of analyzing an argument and inferring that, since it contains a fallacy, its conclusion must be false. A fallacious argument can, by coincidence, arrive at a true conclusion.","Person A: 'All cats are animals. Ginger is an animal. Therefore, Ginger is a cat.' Person B: 'You have committed a fallacy. Therefore, Ginger is not a cat.' (The conclusion could still be true).","formal"
82,"Existential Fallacy","A formal fallacy where a conclusion that asserts existence is drawn from premises that do not assert existence. This typically occurs in a categorical syllogism.","All unicorns have horns. All unicorns are magical creatures. Therefore, some magical creatures have horns. (The argument is fallacious because it concludes something exists from premises about a non-existent class).","formal"
83,"Modal Fallacy","A fallacy in modal logic where a statement of possibility or necessity is confused. A common form is confusing 'It is not necessarily true that P' with 'It is necessarily true that not-P.'","The president will necessarily be over 35 years old. John is over 35. Therefore, John is necessarily the president.","formal"
84,"Kettle Logic","Using multiple, inconsistent arguments to defend a single point. The name comes from a story where a man defends returning a damaged kettle by arguing: (1) he never borrowed it, (2) it was already damaged, and (3) it was in perfect condition when he returned it.","A student accused of cheating argues: 'I didn't cheat on the test. Besides, I only looked at my neighbor's paper for one question. And anyway, everyone else was cheating too.'","relevance"
85,"Loaded Question","A question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption (e.g., a presumption of guilt). Answering such a question directly implies agreement with the assumption.","Have you stopped cheating on your exams? This question presupposes that the person has cheated in the past. Either a 'yes' or 'no' answer traps the respondent.","relevance"
86,"Appeal to Accomplishment","This fallacy occurs when an arguer bases the supposed validity of their argument on their own or others' accomplishments, which are irrelevant to the argument's substance.","I have built a billion-dollar company from scratch, so you should listen to my advice on foreign policy. Business success does not grant expertise in international relations.","relevance"
87,"Argument from Repetition (Ad Nauseam)","This fallacy involves repeating an assertion over and over again in place of better evidence. The repetition can make the claim seem more believable, regardless of its truthfulness.","A political campaign repeatedly airs a commercial with a simple, catchy slogan. After hearing it dozens of times, voters may start to believe it without having seen any supporting evidence.","relevance"
88,"Definist Fallacy","This fallacy involves defining a term in a biased or loaded way to favor one's own position in an argument, effectively making their conclusion true by definition.","In a debate about freedom, someone argues: 'True freedom is not doing what you want, but doing what is morally right.' They then argue their position is morally right, thus making it an act of 'true freedom' by their own definition.","ambiguity"
89,"Double Bind","A rhetorical device where a person is offered two choices, but both choices lead to the same undesirable outcome for them, effectively trapping them. It creates a 'no-win' situation.","A manager tells an employee: 'I need you to be more assertive, but don't step on anyone's toes.' The employee is criticized whether they act independently or remain passive.","relevance"
90,"False Attribution","This fallacy involves citing an unreliable, biased, irrelevant, or even fabricated source to support an argument. The goal is to give the appearance of authority or evidence where there is none.","According to a study from the Institute for Beverage Research, drinking three sodas a day is healthy. The 'Institute' may be a front group funded entirely by soda companies.","relevance"
91,"Thought-Terminating Cliché","A commonly used phrase or folk wisdom used to end a debate or dismiss a complex issue, preventing further critical thought. It provides a simple, comforting answer but avoids genuine engagement.","When discussing the complexities of a social problem, someone ends the conversation by saying, 'It is what it is.' This cliché shuts down any further analysis or exploration of potential solutions.","relevance"
92,"Appeal to Coincidence","This fallacy occurs when an arguer dismisses strong evidence of a causal link by claiming the correlation is merely a coincidence, often without providing evidence for the coincidence itself.","It's just a coincidence that every time our CEO sells his stock, the company announces bad news a week later. This dismisses a suspicious pattern that likely points to insider trading.","causal"
93,"Appeal to Complexity","This fallacy asserts that a conclusion is false because the argument supporting it is too complex for the audience (or the arguer) to understand. It confuses incomprehension with invalidity.","The scientific paper explaining climate change is full of complex models and jargon I can't follow, so I don't think the conclusions are trustworthy.","relevance"
94,"Two Wrongs Make a Right","This fallacy occurs when a person attempts to justify an action against another person by asserting that the other person did or would do the same to them. It uses a supposed or actual wrong to justify another wrong.","Yes, I keyed his car, but he cheated on me first! The initial wrongdoing does not morally or legally justify the retaliatory act of vandalism.","relevance"
95,"Appeal to the Law","Arguing that something is morally right because it is legal, or morally wrong because it is illegal. This fallacy equates legal standards with ethical standards, which are not always the same.","There's nothing wrong with the way our company treats its overseas workers, because we are following all the local labor laws. The legality of the actions does not automatically make them ethical.","relevance"
96,"Chronological Snobbery","The argument that the thinking, art, or science of an earlier time is inherently inferior to that of the present, simply by virtue of its temporal succession. It dismisses past ideas as outdated without assessing their merits.","Why would you read ancient philosophy? Modern science has already disproven all that old-fashioned thinking. This dismisses entire fields of thought based on their age.","relevance"
97,"Courtier's Reply","A fallacy where a claim is dismissed by asserting the critic lacks sufficient knowledge or credentials to make the claim, without addressing the substance of the criticism itself. It is a specific form of ad hominem.","After an outsider points out a clear contradiction in an economic theory, an economist replies, 'You can't possibly understand; you haven't studied advanced econometrics for years like I have.'","relevance"
98,"Damning with Faint Praise","To attack a person or idea by formally offering praise, but for a quality so minor or trivial as to suggest that the person or idea has no major valuable qualities.","When asked for a letter of recommendation for a former employee, a manager writes, 'I can attest that he was always punctual for work.' The praise is so faint that it implies there is nothing else positive to say.","relevance"
99,"Galileo Gambit","The argument that because one's unconventional ideas are ridiculed or rejected by the mainstream, they must be correct, by analogy to historical figures like Galileo who were once dismissed but later proven right.","They all laughed at my theory that the earth is hollow, but they also laughed at Galileo! My theory must be true. The fact that some correct ideas were once ridiculed does not mean all ridiculed ideas are correct.","relevance"
100,"Gish Gallop","A rhetorical technique in which a person in a debate attempts to overwhelm their opponent by providing an excessive number of arguments, regardless of their accuracy, relevance, or strength.","In a debate, one person rattles off dozens of misleading statistics, half-truths, and misinterpretations in a two-minute speech. Their opponent is left unable to address the flood of misinformation.","relevance"
101,"I'm Entitled to My Opinion","A declaration used to shut down a debate or shield a belief from scrutiny. While people are entitled to their opinions, this phrase is used fallaciously to imply that all opinions are equally valid and should not be challenged.","After having their claims about astrology debunked with evidence, a person concludes with, 'Well, that's your view. I'm entitled to my opinion.' This is used to avoid conceding the argument.","relevance"
102,"Poisoning the Well","A type of ad hominem where adverse information about a target is preemptively presented to an audience, with the intention of discrediting or ridiculing everything that the target person is about to say.","Before a debate, a moderator says, 'Our next speaker is a convicted felon and a known liar. Please listen to what he has to say.' The audience is now primed to distrust the speaker.","relevance"
103,"Reductio ad Hitlerum","The attempt to invalidate someone's position on the grounds that the same view was held by Adolf Hitler or the Nazi Party. It is a highly inflammatory form of the association fallacy.","You're arguing for vegetarianism? You know, Hitler was also a vegetarian! This attempts to taint the position by associating it with a reviled historical figure.","relevance"
104,"Style Over Substance Fallacy","This fallacy occurs when an arguer's manner of presentation (e.g., their charisma or confidence) is judged to be more important than the content, logic, or evidence of their argument.","The candidate's speech was so powerful and inspiring; he must be right about the economy. The listener is persuaded by the eloquent delivery rather than a critical analysis of the plan.","relevance"
105,"Tone Policing","A fallacy that focuses on the emotion or tone of a message rather than the message's substance, in an effort to dismiss the argument or derail the discussion. It is a type of red herring.","After a person passionately argues against a social injustice, a listener responds, 'I can't take your argument seriously when you're so angry. You need to calm down and be more civil.'","relevance"
106,"Vacuous Truth","A statement that is technically true but conveys no useful information because the premise (the 'if' part) is empty or applies to nothing. It is true only because the condition is never met.","The statement 'All of my cars that are made of solid gold are currently parked in my garage' is vacuously true because the speaker owns no cars made of solid gold.","formal"
107,"Willed Ignorance (Willful Ignorance)","The tendency to avoid or ignore information that might be unpleasant or contradict one's existing beliefs. It is a deliberate choice to remain uninformed to protect a cherished viewpoint.","A person refuses to read any scientific reports on the health risks of their favorite food, saying, 'I don't want to know, I just want to enjoy it.'","relevance"
108,"Motte-and-Bailey Fallacy","A rhetorical strategy where an arguer conflates two positions: one modest and easy to defend (the 'motte') and one more controversial (the 'bailey'). The arguer advances the bailey, and when challenged, retreats to the safety of the motte.","Someone argues for the 'bailey': 'Society should be radically restructured to eliminate all hierarchies.' When challenged, they retreat to the 'motte': 'All I'm saying is, we should be nicer to each other.'","relevance"
109,"Appeal to Consequences","Arguing that a proposition must be true or false because the consequences of it being true or false are desirable or undesirable. The consequences of a belief have no bearing on its truthfulness.","A universe that was created by a loving God is a much more comforting thought than one that arose from random chance. Therefore, God must exist.","relevance"
110,"Appeal to Force (Argumentum ad Baculum)","This fallacy occurs when an arguer attempts to persuade not by reasoning, but by threatening or intimidating the other person. It is a threat, explicit or subtle, instead of an argument.","If you don't agree with my political views, you will lose your job at this company. The threat of being fired replaces any logical argument for the political views.","relevance"
111,"Appeal to Common Sense","Asserting that a conclusion is true because it is 'common sense.' This is fallacious because many things that were once considered common sense (e.g., the Earth is flat) have been proven false.","It's just common sense that if you spare the rod, you spoil the child. This avoids providing actual evidence for the effectiveness or ethics of corporal punishment.","relevance"
112,"Bulverism","Coined by C.S. Lewis, this fallacy involves assuming an opponent's argument is invalid because of their psychological motive or identity, and then proceeding to explain that motive without ever refuting the argument itself.","You only believe in that moral principle because you were raised in a religious household. I can explain why your upbringing led you to this view... This dismisses the principle by explaining its supposed origin.","relevance"
113,"Fallacy of Relative Privation (Not as Bad As)","Dismissing an argument or complaint due to the existence of more important problems in the world, regardless of whether those issues are relevant to the current discussion.","Person A: 'I'm upset that my flight was delayed by an hour.' Person B: 'You shouldn't complain, there are people starving in the world.'","relevance"
114,"False Analogy","This fallacy consists in assuming that because two things are alike in one or more respects, they are necessarily alike in some other, often crucial, respect. The analogy is not strong enough to support the conclusion.","Government, like a business, should be run with an eye toward profit. This is a weak analogy because a government's primary responsibilities are not profit-driven.","ambiguity"
115,"Appeal to Closure","The argument that a conclusion must be accepted because it provides a sense of finality or closure to a complex or unsettling issue. The need for closure is prioritized over the evidence.","This murder case has gone on for too long; we must convict the current suspect so the family can have closure and we can all move on.","relevance"
116,"Ignoratio Elenchi (Irrelevant Conclusion)","This fallacy occurs when an argument which is supposed to prove one proposition ends up proving a different, often related but irrelevant, one. The arguer misses the point of the debate.","In a debate about the safety of a new law, a politician argues, 'This law is good because we need to do something about the problem!' This argues for the need for action, but not for the merit of the specific law.","relevance"
117,"Non Sequitur","Latin for 'it does not follow,' this is a general term for a conclusion that does not logically follow from the premises. The connection between the premise and conclusion is missing or nonsensical.","My opponent enjoys classical music, and so did the Roman emperors. He would therefore be a tyrannical leader. There is no logical connection between musical taste and leadership style.","formal"
118,"Appeal to Motive","A fallacy where an argument is dismissed by questioning the motive of the person making it, rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself. It is a specific type of ad hominem.","This scientist is arguing for stricter environmental regulations. He's probably just looking for more government grant money for his research. This attacks the scientist's presumed motive.","relevance"
119,"Broken Window Fallacy","An economic fallacy that argues a destructive event, like breaking a window, is good for the economy because it stimulates spending on repairs. It ignores the unseen costs—the money could have been spent on something new.","The hurricane was a blessing in disguise because it created so many construction jobs to rebuild the city. This overlooks the fact that the resources could have been used for new progress.","causal"
120,"Circular Claim","A form of begging the question where the premise of an argument is merely a restatement of the conclusion, often in slightly different words. It offers no new information.","Our product is the best on the market because no other product is superior to it. The premise ('no other product is superior') is just another way of saying the conclusion.","relevance"
121,"Appeal to Inconvenience","The assertion that an argument must be false because accepting it would be difficult, inconvenient, or require significant effort. The convenience of a belief does not determine its truth.","Believing in climate change would mean I have to change my lifestyle. That's too much trouble, so I don't think it's real.","relevance"
122,"Argument by Gibberish (Bafflement)","A fallacy that involves using overly complex, obscure, or technical-sounding language (jargon) to give the impression of intelligence and to intimidate or confuse an opponent into accepting a conclusion.","Utilizing synergistic paradigms to leverage our core competencies, we can effectuate a paradigm shift in our operational matrix. The statement is mostly meaningless jargon.","relevance"
123,"Moral High Ground Fallacy","This fallacy occurs when someone assumes they are correct in their argument simply because they believe they occupy a morally superior position. It uses self-perceived virtue as a substitute for evidence.","I am a compassionate and caring person, unlike my opponent. Therefore, my proposal for healthcare reform is better. The speaker's self-proclaimed moral character is irrelevant to the policy.","relevance"
124,"Proof by Verbosity (Argumentum Verbosium)","The fallacy of overwhelming an opponent with a massive volume of information, so much so that they cannot possibly respond to it all. It is related to the Gish Gallop but focuses on sheer volume.","In response to a simple question, a person submits a 500-page document full of charts and data, and then claims their position is proven because the opponent cannot possibly analyze it all.","relevance"
125,"Fallacy of the Excluded Middle","A specific form of a false dilemma where it is assumed that only two extreme, opposing positions are the only options, while ignoring the possibility of moderate views or a continuum of options between them.","If you don't support this new security bill with its invasive surveillance, you must want terrorists to win. This presents only the two extremes, excluding any nuanced position.","ambiguity"
126,"Appeal to Self-Interest","This fallacy attempts to persuade an audience to accept a conclusion by appealing to their personal interests, desires, or benefits, rather than by providing logical evidence for the conclusion itself.","You should vote for this tax cut because it will put more money directly into your pocket. This doesn't address whether the tax cut is beneficial for the economy as a whole.","relevance"
127,"Accent Fallacy","A fallacy of ambiguity that occurs when the meaning of a sentence is changed by placing an unusual emphasis on a word or phrase.","A sign says 'Free beer tomorrow.' When you return the next day, the bartender says 'It's free beer *tomorrow*, not today!' The emphasis changes the meaning.","ambiguity"

130,"Chronological Snobbery","The argument that the thinking, art, or science of an earlier time is inherently inferior to that of the present, simply by virtue of its temporal succession.","'Why would you read ancient philosophy? Modern science has already disproven all that old-fashioned thinking.'","relevance"
131,"Conspiracy Theory Fallacy (Argument from Suspicion)","The fallacy of dismissing evidence by claiming it's part of a larger conspiracy, without providing evidence for the conspiracy itself.","'The moon landing was faked.

133,"Essentializing Fallacy","Attributing natural, essential characteristics to members of a specific group, while ignoring variation among members.","'All politicians are corrupt.' This statement ignores the existence of honest politicians and treats a complex group as a monolith.","ambiguity"
134,"Fallacy of the General Rule (A Dicto Simpliciter ad Dictum Secundum Quid)","Applying a general rule to a specific case where the rule is inapplicable.","'Cutting people with knives is a crime.

136,"Mind Projection Fallacy","The fallacy of assuming that the way one sees the world reflects the way the world really is.","'I can't imagine how a computer could be truly intelligent, so artificial intelligence is impossible.' One's own imaginative limits do not define reality.","formal"
137,"Proving Too Much","An argument that, if taken to its logical conclusion, would prove something the arguer would not want to prove.","'All property is theft. Therefore, no one should own anything.' This would also apply to the arguer's own possessions, which they likely wouldn't want to give up.","relevance"
138,"Psychogenetic Fallacy","Dismissing a belief by explaining the psychological reasons someone might have for holding it, rather than addressing the belief's merits.","'You only believe in God because you're afraid of death.' This attacks the supposed motive for the belief, not the arguments for it.","relevance"
139,"Reductio ad Absurdum (Valid Use)","A valid argumentative move that seeks to demonstrate that a statement is true by showing that a false, untenable, or absurd result follows from its denial. Not a fallacy in itself, but can be used to create fallacies.","If you claim that all numbers are even, I can show this is absurd by pointing to the number 3. This is a valid use to disprove a claim.","formal"
140,"Reductio ad Absurdum (Fallacious Use)","Misusing the Reductio ad Absurdum form by stretching the logic to an absurd conclusion that does not actually follow from the opponent's claim.","'If we allow same-sex marriage, then soon people will be wanting to marry their pets!' This is a fallacious extension of the original argument.","relevance"
141,"Shifting the Burden of Proof","I'm not going to prove my claim, you have to prove it's false.","'I believe a giant, invisible unicorn lives in my garage. You can't prove it doesn't exist, so it must be true.'","relevance"
142,"Slippery Slope (Causal)","A specific type of slippery slope that argues a chain of cause-and-effect events will occur, leading to a negative outcome, without sufficient evidence for the causal links.","'If we legalize marijuana, then more people will try harder drugs, leading to a massive increase in crime and addiction.'

This is fallacious when discussing objective facts, like whether Paris is the capital of France.","relevance"
144,"Suppressed Correlative","An argument that tries to redefine a correlative (one of two mutually exclusive options) so that one alternative is no longer possible.","'I'm not being lazy, I'm just on an energy-saving kick.' This redefines 'lazy' to exclude the speaker's behavior.","ambiguity"
145,"Tokenism","Interpreting a small, symbolic gesture as an adequate substitute for more substantial action.","'Our company is committed to diversity; we hired one woman in a senior role last year.' This small action is presented as proof of a larger commitment that may not exist.","relevance"
146,"Unfalsifiability (Untestability)","Offering a claim that cannot be proven false, because there is no way to check if it is false or not.","'There is an invisible, undetectable dragon living in my attic. You can't see, hear, or measure it in any way, but it's there.'","relevance"
